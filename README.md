## Improved Inference Methods Based on Quasi-Likelihood Ratio Statistics for Modified Poisson and Least-Squares Regressions

Modified Poisson and least-squares regression analyses for binary outcomes have been standard multivariate analysis methods to estimate risk ratio and risk difference in clinical and epidemiological studies. Recent studies have shown the ordinary robust variance estimator possibly has serious bias under small or moderate sample size situations for these methods. This package provides computational tools to calculate improved confidence intervals for the effect measures based on the quasi-likelihood ratio statistics (Noma et al. (2024) <Forthcoming>).
